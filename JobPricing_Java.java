/*Herbertâ€™s Home Repair estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on the job, plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site.
The main() method prompts the user for the name of a job (for example, Smith bathroom remodel), the cost of materials, the number of hours of work required, and the number of hours travel time.
The main method is complete and it calls the computePrice(), write the code for the computePrice() method so that when the method is called from the main method, it executes as intended
Pass the numeric data to a method computePrice() that computes an estimate for the job and returns the computed value to the main() method which displays the job name and estimated price. */
