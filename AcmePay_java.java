/*

 Acme Parts runs a small factory and employs workers who are paid one of three hourly rates depending on their shift:

1	First shift, $17 per hour; 
2	Second shift, $18.50 per hour;
3	Third shift, $22 per hour.


Each factory worker might work any number of hours per week; any hours greater than 40 are paid at one and one-half times the usual rate.
In addition, second- and third-shift workers can elect to participate in the retirement plan for which 3% of the workerï¿½s gross pay is deducted from the paychecks.

Write a program that prompts the user for hours worked, shift, and, if the shift is 2 or 3, whether the worker elects the retirement (1 for yes, 2 for no). Display:
1.	Hours worked
2.	Shift
3.	Hourly pay rate
4.	Regular pay
5.	Overtime pay
6.	Total of regular and overtime pay
7.	Retirement deduction, if any
8.	Net pay.
